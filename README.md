# Shades
> A simple screen filter app for Android.

**NOTE**: This project now only serves as a technical demo for achieving screen filters in Android. **Shades** has been forked by [@raatmarien](https://github.com/raatmarien) and re-branded as [Red Moon](https://github.com/raatmarien/red-moon), and is now available on the Play Store.

Shades lets you [put on your figurative sunglasses](http://capcomprotour.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GuileSunglasses-300x185.png) when you look at your phone or tablet. You can use Shades to dim the screen even more than the lowest Android brightness setting, which your night-time-reading eyes will thank you for, or even give your screen a colored tint!

  * Notification allows user to open the Shades settings page, or pause or turn off Shades
